# WordHunter

A better Word Hunt! Select a tile and type a letter to fill it (arrow keys can also be used to move selected tile). Design the shape of your board however you like by filling tiles, and hit shuffle when satisfied. Drag together tiles to form words and score as much as possible in one minute! Try the in-development version [here](https://praccho.github.io/WordHunter/)! Also see the version with a backend [here](https://github.com/Praccho/WordHunterFS/). Made with React.
